# presenter-timer

Reason for this project:
For work I need a way to let event presenters know how much time they have left. There are several solutions (PowerPoint, LED digital clocks, Stoplight lights, Apps...) but I have not found anything that meets all the criteria I am looking at. The closest is Google's timer that pops up in search results if you Google "create a countdown timer." 

###What I like about Google's timer:
- It is simple and feels modern.
- The bar is a great visual cue to show where you are at within the alotted time!

###Features to change:
- Open the full screen in a separate window (add target = blank)
- Invert the display colors so it is easier to see the time from a distance (adjust CSS)
- Make the bar a littler thicker (increase stroke weight)
- Make the beep at the end a visual cue (change the css background color)
- Make it a standalone web app so I don't have to constantly search it

###If I have time:
- Record the difference between when the timer ends and the speaker wraps up.
